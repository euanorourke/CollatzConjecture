# CollatzConjecture
A C++ implementation of a Collatz Conjecture calculator
## What is it?
The Collatz conjecture is a longstanding unsolved problem in mathematics. It states that repeating a sequence of certain operations will eventually lead to the number 1. If the number is even, divide it by 2 and, if the number is odd, multiply it by three and add 1. It's named after mathematician Lothar Collatz.
